                <h3>Work</h3>
                <p>In case anyone was on the edge of their seat, we got Victor (the computer) back from the IT people and I revived him and got all of our databases set up again, which ended up being a worthwhile activity because I was able to update the setup documentation that was very out of date. We learned that another one of our computers (named Sigma) was registered in the wrong research group and was going to have to be reset at some point anyway, so we got that done too while we were in the resetting mindset.</p>
                <p>We had another strange mishap because apparently the container our pipeline runs in wants to contact the wrong IP address and was somehow pinging the OneCard server? The OneCard people thought they were being repeatedly attacked and alerted the IT people who then figured that it was just little old us. Unfortunately now that they have blocked us our pipeline has stopped working, but that does raise the question of why our pipeline was ever able to find its database at the OneCard server IP address in the first place. I am very confused.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the fact that we haven't passed any pipelines in a month, we are continuing development, which we/I may severely regret later, but we have finally got to the point of development where we connect my thesis work to the front end of the tool which is very exciting and involves a lot of design conversations that are basically my favorite thing ever.<p>
                <p>We also have a journal extension paper due on Saturday. I wrote most of the first draft in September but we are now editing it and I am doing a bunch of data processsing which is also fun. Between applications and this paper, I am spending a lot of late nights in Ford.</p>

                <h3>Knick the Knee</h3>
                <p>For the nine monthiversary of surgery, I had a Knick is the Consistency of Cheese party in my basement home. We ate cheese in the form of queso, blueberry lavender goat cheese, smoked gouda, and dill havarti.</p>
                <p>I saw the surgeon for the last time and he said not to play real soccer yet but I can do ball things on my own and just decide based on vibes when I can start playing pickup.</p>

                <h3>Weekends</h3>
                <p>When the last update came out, I was still in Boston. Katie had a cafe situation with homemade drinks and bakery items. It was fun to hang out and then we watched the trains.</p>
                <p>I went to the double header of the US Deaf MNT and USWNT game in Hartford. Both games finished 3-1. In the USWNT game, all three goals were scored by Thorns players. I went with Riley and Sky and also ran into Burgs, a bunch of the soccer team, and Kathy.</p>
                <p>Smith's last game was at Coast Guard, so I drove down with Katherine and gave her a mini tour of Salem and East Lyme from inside of the car. I stayed the rest of the weekend to watch NWSL Decision Day at home (where there is wifi and the maximal number of screens). All the results on Decision Day went the way they needed to for the Thorns to finish third; they later won their quarterfinal in overtime but let in two terrible goals to lose the semifinal.</p>
                <p>I also took a weekend trip to New York. After a slight train debacle, I arrived and met up with Chelsea, Wesley, and Sophie. We intended to go to Broadway karaoke at a gay bar but the line was too long so instead we ate pizza and then yapped until approximately 3am. The following day, Chelsea and I ate baked goods and fun drinks on the roof of their apartment and then went to the Natural History Museum, where we did the ocean and forest rooms. We met up with Wesley for dinner and dessert-flavored shots, and then Chelsea and I went to see the musical Batboy. It was absolutely insane. We did not know what it was about going in and our jaws were on the floor by the end. It was great though. I got coffee with Mercer the next morning and then took the train back north.</p>
                <p>Last weekend, Fruit Street and guests went to see Hold Onto Your Butts at the Academy of Music, which was a comedy/play situation with two guys re-creatung Jurassic Park while another person made all the sound effects. It was funny and the sound effects were truly impressive.</p>
